# Finite‑Difference Analysis of an L‑Shaped Plate

> **Authors & roles**
> *• *Yu‑Chih Chi (紀詠喆)* — derived the 17‑node finite‑difference formulas and built the initial MATLAB prototype.
> *• Current maintainer — ported the solver to Python and added 3‑D/animated visualisation.
> *• This project was originally completed as a final report for the undergraduate Heat Transfer course at National Chung Cheng University (2023), by Yu-Chih Chi and [Yu-Tse Wu]. It is published here for reference and demonstration purposes.

The lower‑right quarter (0.1 m × 0.1 m) is removed, leaving **1281 active nodes** on a 41 × 41 mesh.

## 2 · Governing equation (plain‑text blocks for safe rendering)

```text

(1)  ρ C_p ∂T/∂t  =  k ( ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² ) + q‴

      with  q‴  =  2 q″ / Δx          (2)

```

### 2.1 Explicit stencil (dimensionless form)

```text

Fourier number :  F₀ = k Δt / ( ρ C_p Δx² )

Update rule :
(3)  T_{i,j}^{n+1} = T_{i,j}^n + F₀ ( T_E + T_W + T_N + T_S – 4 T_P ) + ( Δt / ρ C_p ) q‴
                    
Stability :  F₀ ≈ 0.097  < 0.25   →  stable.

```

## 3 · 17‑node formulation *(Yu‑Chih Chi)*

```text

Generic energy balance for any node type :
(4)  a_P T_P  =  Σ a_nb T_nb  +  b

Seventeen distinct connectivity cases arise due to the L‑shaped cut‑out; their
coefficients (a_P, a_nb, b) follow Chi’s original derivation.

```

## Usage & results

Run `src/l_plate_explicit.py` (Python 3.8+) to generate:

* `output/steady_state.png` — static 3‑D temperature surface
* `output/steady_rotation.gif` — 360° rotating view
* `output/temp_evolution.gif` — 2‑D transient animation

Sample output:
